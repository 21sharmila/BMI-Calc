The BMI Calculator is a lightweight web tool implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that computes Body Mass Index from a userâ€™s height and weight. 
It validates inputs, displays results with an interpretation (underweight/normal/overweight/obese), and offers a clean, accessible UI for quick health assessments.
